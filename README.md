# data-science-learning-hub
A personal knowledge hub for my journey into Data Science. This repository organizes my favorite resources—GitHub repos, books, articles, and my own projects—across Python, SQL, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Generative AI. Built for easy revision, portfolio building, and lifelong learning.
